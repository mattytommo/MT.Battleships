MT.Battleships
==============

Implementation of Battleships in C# based on the specification below:

You should create a simple console application in C# to allow a single human player to play a onesided game of battleships against the computer.

The program should create a 10x10 grid, and place a number of ships on the grid at random with the following sizes:
● 1x Battleship (5 squares)
● 2x Destroyers (4 squares)

The console application should accept input from the user in the format “A5” to signify a square to target, and feedback to the user whether the shot was success, and additionally
report on the sinking of any vessels.

Do not spend any time formatting output in the console window (displaying a grid etc.) focus on the domain, not the presentation.
